>LollyPopMenu

Using Node develop an application called LollyPop Menu. The main idea here is to generate a JSON menu from your chosen Lollypops. The user will drag and drop the LollyPop image from one area to another to generate the JSON menu. There areas should be both sortable and be able to accommodate movement from one to another and back again. The User shall be able to add images (png only) and be able to reset the menu to start again.   

-	Menu should be Dragable and droppable and sortable 
-	The images shall be generated on the screen dynamically to accommodate extra image insertion
-	File upload option using Node.js
-	Testing required
-	Comments required
